# syndesi-ui

This UI-library is intended to be used alongside any JS-library. Therefore no
custom JS is implemented, but there are instructions how to implement the
required interactions on the component's pages.

The online documentation can be visited at
[syndesi.github.io/syndesi-ui](https://syndesi.github.io/syndesi-ui/).
